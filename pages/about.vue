          On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of linguistics program at BOUN in 2018, the Bogazici Linguistics Student Circle (BLC) wished to expand the scope of its biannual student presentation event to include presentations by students from other departments as well as other universities. We aimed to offer students the opportunity to interact with other students and scholars working on experimental and theoretical linguistics outside their immediate academic community.
          <br><br>
          The BLC organized the first BUSCTEL last year in which students from graduate and undergraduate levels presented their work. BUSCTEL drew more than 300 participants, 28 speakers, and 100 paper submissions from 12 different faculties around Turkey.
          <br><br>
          This year we will again accept posters as well as talks and offers an extra time slot for posters in order to allow participants to directly talk to the speakers and other researchers and experience for themselves their studies first hand.
          <br><br>
          The BLC Committee is glad to announce BUSCTEL '20, in which students from graduate and undergraduate levels will present their work and posters, will be held on February 22-23, 2020.
